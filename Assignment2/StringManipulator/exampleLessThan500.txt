Though biotechnology, researchers can modify the phytochemical and nutrient makeup of foods by altering the genetic makeup of plants. Resulting plants are called genetically modified or GM plants. The process of biotechnology usually entails identifying a favorable genetic trait in one plant and transplanting that gene into another plant that lacks the characteristic. The genetic make up of plants has actually been modified for centuries.
